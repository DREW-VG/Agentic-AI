After weighing the arguments presented by both sides on the motion "The emergence of AI will boost the economy despite the risk of increasing unemployment because of AI," I have reached a decision based solely on the strength of the arguments presented.

The proponent of the motion argues that AI will drive economic growth through productivity gains, innovation, and the creation of new industries. They acknowledge the unemployment concerns but contend that historical patterns of technological advancement show economies adapt and ultimately thrive. Their argument emphasizes that AI will automate routine tasks while humans shift to higher-value roles requiring uniquely human skills, leading to increased economic output and improved quality of work. Additionally, they argue that AI-driven efficiency will reduce costs, accelerate R&D, and enhance global competitiveness.

The opponent counters that the pace and scale of AI-driven unemployment is not merely transitional but potentially destabilizing. They argue that historical examples show uneven adaptation in job markets, with many workers facing prolonged unemployment. The opponent raises concerns about a widening skills gap, disproportionate impacts on lower-wage sectors, and increasing economic inequality. They also warn that prioritizing automation could devalue human labor and creative skills essential for a healthy economy.

Based on the arguments presented, I find the opponent's position more convincing. While the proponent offers optimistic predictions about economic benefits, their argument relies heavily on historical patterns that may not apply to AI's unique capabilities and deployment speed. The opponent provides more specific, concrete concerns about the distributional effects of AI-driven unemployment, the skills gap, and the potential for increasing inequality. 

The opponent's argument acknowledges the potential productivity gains but provides a more nuanced analysis of who might benefit from these gains and who might be left behind. They effectively challenge the assumption that economic benefits will naturally outweigh or compensate for unemployment risks, pointing out structural barriers to workforce adaptation. The opponent also raises important questions about the social consequences of devaluing human labor that the proponent does not adequately address.

The proponent's argument would have been strengthened by providing specific evidence of how previous technological revolutions have ultimately created more jobs than they eliminated, or by offering concrete policy proposals to address the transitional challenges they acknowledge. Without these elements, their optimistic outlook appears less substantiated than the opponent's more detailed critique.

Therefore, based solely on the arguments presented, I find the opponent's position against the motion more compelling and better supported.
