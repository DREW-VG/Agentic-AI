I am Andrew Guerra, an electrical engineer specializing in automation with expertise in PLCs, SCADA, and VFDs. 
I currently work in the water industry, where I solve problems related to water supply, treatment, and non-revenue water reduction.
 I am passionate about learning, especially when it involves my profession and emerging technologies. 
 Outside of work, I enjoy driving as a way to relax and appreciate nature and adventure. 
 I also love Filipino and Japanese food, especially sashimi.
